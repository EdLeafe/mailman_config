Hi Ed!

I can understand your time constraints and appreciate whatever time you 
can give this problem. In addition to trying to fix whatever I've done 
to my Dabo install I'm trying to fix this crap Outlook port that M$ has 
jammed down our throats. I think I might have finally gotten it to stop 
putting the dabo-users mail into 'Junk".

Anyway, the two levels of 'dabo-0.9.9' are the result of unzipping the 
Dabo download. I tried several times to run the Windows install routine 
and Easy Install and this is what I've ended up with. I really think I 
just screwed up the install completely before I decided to run with the 
subversion method. I might be best off to blow away all the Dabo stuff, 
just unpack the files again and try subversion again. Advice?

Thanks, again,

Bill

Hi Ed!

Ok, I created a new folder call "Dabo". I moved the install pack 
(dabo-0.9.9.zip) into it. I unzipped the file and it created a folder 
named c:\dabo\dabo-0.9.9. As would be expected there are various 
sub-folders (dabo, demo, ide,tests, tools, ander vendor) along with a 
few files. I modified the dabo.pth file in Python27's site-packages 
folder to "c:\dabo\dabo-0.9.9". I then double clicked on 
"c:\dabo\dabo-0.9.9\ide\ClassDesigner". Up comes the "Open/Create Class" 
window. I select "OK" to create a new form. Up comes "the "Object Info", 
"Editing: ..." and "Dabo Class Designer" windows. All of the same menu 
problems (dMenuItem) are there.

Does this help you at all?

Bill
